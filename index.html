  <h3>My skills</h3>
  <!--this next is a nested table  it has two colums and two table data ccells
  it uses html to make tables but it is not the best way to do this qhich is css
  but by doing it i can learn a lot about tables even though I will use the more efficient css
  in the future-->
  <!--so you can use the structure of a single table with two tables nested inside-->
  <!--then we learn how to give spacing to tables-->
